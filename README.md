# Image Processing with OpenCV
This repository contains Python scripts for performing image processing using OpenCV. The scripts demonstrate the application of various filters and techniques, including Gabor filter, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection, Laplacian filter, and Magnitude Spectrum computation.

# Features

## 1. Gabor Filter
The Gabor filter is applied to highlight texture and specific frequency components in the image. It is often used in texture analysis and feature extraction.

## 2. Gaussian Blur
Gaussian blur smooths the image by reducing noise and detail. It is commonly used as a preprocessing step in many image processing pipelines.

## 3. Canny Edge Detection
The Canny edge detection algorithm identifies edges in the image by detecting intensity gradients.

## 4. Laplacian Filter
The Laplacian filter calculates the second derivative of the image intensity, highlighting regions of rapid intensity change.

## 5. Magnitude Spectrum
The Magnitude Spectrum is computed using the Fourier Transform to visualize the frequency domain representation of the image.

## Applications of Image Processing

Image processing is widely used in various fields, including:

### Medical Imaging: 
Enhancing images from X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans for better diagnosis.

### Computer Vision: 
Enabling applications like object detection, face recognition, and autonomous vehicles.

### Robotics: 
Assisting in navigation and environment mapping.

### Entertainment: 
Special effects, video editing, and animation.

### Security: 
Surveillance systems and biometric authentication.

### Remote Sensing: 
Analyzing satellite and aerial imagery for environmental monitoring and mapping.

# Usage
Place your input image in the images directory (or update the script paths accordingly).

Run the script:

* python process_image.py

Outputs will be saved in the output directory, with visualizations displayed for interactive inspection.
